Czech Sort
==========

This is a pure-Python library Czech-language albhabetical sorting.


Quick Use
---------

From Python::

    >>> import czech_sort

    >>> czech_sort.sorted(['sídliště', 'shoda', 'schody'])
    ['shoda', 'schody', 'sídliště']

    >>> sorted(['sídliště', 'shoda', 'schody'], key=czech_sort.key)
    ['shoda', 'schody', 'sídliště']

On the command line::

    $ python -m czech_sort < file.txt
    shoda
    schody
    sídliště


Why another sorting library?
----------------------------

To sort Python strings in the Czech language, there are three other options:

* Use `PyICU`_. This can sort *really* well, and do all kinds of wonderful,
  standards-compliant Unicode things. Perfect for publication-quality results.
  Unfortunately, ICU can be a major pain to install, making it overkill if you
  just want to sort a list of strings.
* Set the locale, then use `locale.strxfrm`_.
  (Yes, ``strxfrm``! Try saying that ten times fast!)
  This depends on the Czech POSIX locale being available, so it's hardly
  portable.
* Just use Python's built-in string sort. This sorts lexicographically by
  Unicode codepoints. It might be good enough for you? Maybe?

Scope
-----

The ``czech-sort`` library is a compromise. It should give you good results in
the 99% case.

Do not use this if you need proper sorting of symbols, non-Latin scripts,
or diacritics other than Czech/Slovak.

Any other deviation from the relevant standard, `ČSN 97 6030`, should be
considered a bug. However, neither the author nor the community at large
have access to the standard, which makes finding such bugs somewhat difficult.


Full API
---------

czech_sort.*sorted*(iterable)

    Takes an iterable of strings, and returns a list of them, sorted.

czech_sort.*key*(s)

    Returns a sort key object for a given string.


Compatibility
-------------

The czech-sort library can be used with Python 2.6+ and 3.3+.

Under Python 2, it only accepts `unicode` strings.


Installation
------------

Install this into your `virtualenv`_ by running:

    pip install czech-sort
